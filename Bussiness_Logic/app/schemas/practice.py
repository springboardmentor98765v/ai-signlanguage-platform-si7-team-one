Practice Service — Pydantic Schemas

These mirror the PracticeSession field design from Day 1
(AI Sign Lang - Business Logic (Intern 4) Notion doc).

NOTE: user_id / lesson_id are plain strings for now since Intern 2's
User Service and Course Service aren't live yet. Once real auth (Day 6)
and seeded lessons (Day 5) exist, these should become validated FKs
(e.g. checked against the User/Lesson tables) rather than free-form strings.
